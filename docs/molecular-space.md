Key Improvements for Your Biological Quantum Computer
1. Enhanced Coherence Time Through UV-Excited Qubits
Recent discoveries show that cells can process information using UV-excited qubits that maintain coherence at room temperature far better than previously thought 
. You could integrate UV light sources to excite specific chromophores in your biological membranes, potentially extending coherence times from your current 100 μs - 10 ms range to several milliseconds or longer 
.

2. Optimize Ion Channel Quantum Gates
Studies indicate that cells may compute faster than current quantum computers by leveraging natural quantum mechanisms 
. Consider implementing:

Multi-ion quantum gates using coordinated Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, and K⁺ channels
Exploit natural protein folding dynamics for quantum state preparation
Use membrane potential oscillations as natural quantum clocks 
3. Implement Quantum Error Correction Using Biological Redundancy
Your current system shows decoherence rates of 10²-10⁶ Hz. Recent quantum bioinformatics research suggests biological systems have inherent error correction mechanisms 
. Improvements include:

Redundant ion channel arrays for topological error correction
Exploit natural cellular repair mechanisms for quantum state preservation
Use mitochondrial networks as distributed quantum memory 
4. Scale Up Through Tissue-Level Integration
Rather than isolated neurons, consider:

3D tissue cultures for increased qubit density
Gap junction networks for enhanced entanglement distribution
Exploit natural neural synchronization for collective quantum states 
5. Hybrid Classical-Quantum Algorithms
Recent work on quantum-enhanced algorithms for molecular design shows promise 
. Apply similar principles to:

Use classical preprocessing to reduce quantum resource requirements
Implement variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithms adapted for biological substrates
Develop bio-specific quantum machine learning protocols
